# LoRaWAN-Based Water Monitoring System

## Overview
This project implements a **LoRaWAN-based Water Monitoring System** to enable remote monitoring of water quality, levels, and consumption. It leverages **LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)** technology for efficient and low-power communication, making it suitable for smart city and industrial applications.

## Features
- **Remote Monitoring**: Enables real-time tracking of water parameters.
- **Water Level Detection**: Monitors water levels in tanks, reservoirs, or natural sources.
- **Quality Monitoring**: Measures parameters like pH, turbidity, and temperature.
- **LoRaWAN Communication**: Uses long-range and low-power communication for reliable data transfer.
- **Leakage Detection**: Alerts users about potential leaks or abnormalities.
- **Scalability**: Can be expanded to monitor multiple water sources.

## System Architecture
The system consists of:
- **LoRa Nodes**: Each sensor unit is connected to a LoRa-enabled microcontroller for data transmission.
- **LoRa Gateway**: Collects data from nodes and forwards it to the cloud.
- **Network Server**: Manages communication between devices and applications.
- **Web Dashboard / Mobile App**: Allows users to monitor water levels and quality remotely.

## Components Used
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 / Arduino + LoRa Module (SX1276/SX1278)
- **LoRa Gateway**: Raspberry Pi with LoRa concentrator or commercial LoRa gateway
- **Cloud Platform**: The Things Network (TTN) / ChirpStack for LoRaWAN network management
- **Sensors**: Ultrasonic/Float sensors for water level, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, temperature sensor
- **Power Supply**: Solar panel or AC mains supply

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Hardware Setup
- Connect LoRa modules to microcontrollers.
- Interface sensors for water level and quality monitoring.
- Deploy LoRa gateway in a strategic location for optimal coverage.

### 2. Software Setup
- Flash the firmware onto the microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32).
- Configure the LoRaWAN parameters (DevEUI, AppEUI, AppKey) in TTN or ChirpStack.
- Deploy the backend server and web dashboard for remote access.

### 3. Deployment
- Install the sensor nodes at the desired water sources.
- Ensure proper network coverage and connectivity.
- Test the monitoring functionality.

## Usage
- Access the web dashboard or mobile app to monitor water levels and quality.
- Configure alerts and automation rules.
- Analyze historical data for trends and anomalies.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with AI for predictive analytics.
- Advanced data visualization for better insights.
- Expansion to industrial water management solutions.
